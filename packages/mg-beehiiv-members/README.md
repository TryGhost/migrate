# Migrate beehiiv Members `csv` Export

Converts a beehiiv members `csv` export and generates a `csv` file you can import into a Ghost installation.


## Install

To install the CLI, which is required for the Usage commands below:

```sh
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate
```

To use this package in your own project:

`npm install @tryghost/mg-beehiiv-members --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-beehiiv-members`


## Usage

To run basic beehiiv member migration, the required command is this:

```sh
migrate beehiiv-members --pathToCsv /path/to/members.csv
```

A more complex command for a beehiiv member migration looks like this:

```sh
migrate beehiiv-members --pathToCsv /path/to/members.csv --verbose true
```

It's possible to pass more options, in order to achieve a better migration file for Ghost:

- **`--pathToCsv`** (required)
    - Path to members CSV file
    - string - default: `null`
- **`--cache`** 
    - Persist local cache after migration is complete (Only if `--zip` is `true`)
    - bool - default: `true`
- **`-V` `--verbose`** 
    - Show verbose output
    - bool - default: `false`
- **`--zip`** 
    - Create a zip file
    - bool - default: `false`
