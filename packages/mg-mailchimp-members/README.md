# Migrate Mailchimp Members `csv` Export

Converts a Mailchimp members `csv` export and generates a `csv` file you can import into a Ghost installation.


## Install

To install the CLI, which is required for the Usage commands below:

```sh
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate
```

To use this package in your own project:

`npm install @tryghost/mg-mailchimp-members --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-mailchimp-members`


## Usage

To run basic Mailchimp member migration, the required command is this:

```sh
migrate mailchimp-members --pathToCsv /path/to/members.csv
```

A more complex command for a Mailchimp member migration looks like this:

```sh
migrate mailchimp-members --pathToCsv /path/to/members.csv, /path/to/another-members.csv --addLabel 'Migrated' --includeUnsubscribed false --verbose true
```

It's possible to pass more options, in order to achieve a better migration file for Ghost:

- **`--pathToCsv`** (required)
    - Path to members CSV file
    - string - default: `null`
- **`--addLabel`**
    - Label to add to all members
    - string - default: `null`
- **`--includeUnsubscribed`** 
    - Include unsubscribed members in the migration, but set to not receive emails
    - bool - default: `true`
- **`--cache`** 
    - Persist local cache after migration is complete (Only if `--zip` is `true`)
    - bool - default: `true`
- **`-V` `--verbose`** 
    - Show verbose output
    - bool - default: `false`
- **`--zip`** 
    - Create a zip file
