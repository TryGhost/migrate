# Migrate Curated Export

Migrate content from Curated using the supplied zip file, and generate a `zip` file you can import into a Ghost installation.


## Install

To install the CLI, which is required for the Usage commands below:

```sh
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate
```

To use this package in your own project:

`npm install @tryghost/mg-curate-export --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-curate-export`


## Usage

To run a Curated migration, the required command is:

```sh
migrate curate <path to zip file>
```

It's possible to pass more options, in order to achieve a better migration file for Ghost:

- **`-V` `--verbose`**
    - bool - default: `false`
    - Show verbose output
- **`--zip`**
    - bool - default: `true`
    - Create a zip file
- **`-e` `--email`**
    - string - default: `false`
    - Provide an email address for posts to attributed to e.g. john@example.com
- **`-n` `--name`**
    - string - default: `false`
    - Provide a name for posts to attributed to e.g. John
- **`-t` `--tag`**
    - string - default: `false`
    - Provide a tag to be applied to every post
- **`--fallBackHTMLCard`**
    - bool - default: `false`
    - Fall back to convert to HTMLCard, if standard Mobiledoc convert fails

A more complex migration command could look like this:

```sh
migrate curate <path to zip file> --email example.com
```

This will process all posts from the zip file, and all authors will have an email address ending in 'example.com'
