# Migrate Fs Utils

## Install

`npm install @tryghost/mg-fs-utils --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-fs-utils`


## Usage

You can add `.env` file in the root of this package to set a different local cache path.
By default, it will create a temporary folder in the system's temp directory, but you may want to chang this to a more permanent location. Setting `CACHE_PATH` in `.env` will override the default.

```env
CACHE_PATH=/path/to/cache
```
