# Migrate Substack CSV Export

## Install

`npm install @tryghost/mg-substack-csv --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-substack-csv`


## Usage

Substack provides an overview `csv` file as well as a folder containing different files for each post.

To run an absolute basic Substack migration, the required command is this:

`migrate substack <path to post.csv file>`

It's possible to pass more options, in order to achieve a better migration file for Ghost:

`--url <URL>`
Provide a URL to the Substack instance, so we can try and scrape additional information for each post

`--readPosts <path to directory containing html files>`
Some Substack exports include a directory with `html` files for each post.

`--email <email of main author>`
Provide an email for users e.g. john@mycompany.com to create a general user w/ slug `john` and provided email

`--drafts true`
You can decide to not import drafts, when the post was e. g. only used to generate a newsletter but never published as a post. In this case the newsletter would be classed as `draft` and you can decide to not import them by setting this flag to false

`--fallBackHTMLCard false`
Fall back to convert to HTMLCard, if standard Mobiledoc convert fails

<hr>

A more realistic command for a Substack migration looks like this:

`migrate substack <path to post.csv file> --url <URL to substack instance> --readPosts <path to directory containing html files> --email <main author email> --drafts false`
