# Curated Ghost CSV Converter

Converts the "Subscribers" CSV export from Curated to a CSV compatible with Ghost.


## Install

To install the CLI, which is required for the Usage commands below:

```sh
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate
```

To use this package in your own project:

`npm install @tryghost/mg-curated-members-csv --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/mg-curated-members-csv`


## Usage

To run a Curated CSV migration, the required command is:

```sh
migrate curated-members --pathToFile /path/to/emails.csv
```

It's possible to pass more options, in order to achieve a better migration file for Ghost:

- **`--pathToFile`** (required)
    - Path to the signups CSV file as generated by Curated
    - string - default: `null`
- **`-V` `--verbose`**
    - Show verbose output
    - bool - default: `false`
- **`-l` `--limit`**
    - Define the batch limit for import files
    - int - default: `5000`
- **`--freeLabel`**
    - Provide a label for Curated `free` subscribers
    - string - default: `curated-free`
- **`--cache`** 
    - Persist local cache after migration is complete (Only if `--zip` is `true`)
    - bool - default: `true`

A more complex migration command that accounts for Stripe data could look like this:

```sh
migrate curated-members emails.csv --freeLabel Newsletter --limit 1000
```
